# English Alphabet Recognition Model
This project uses timm's "efficientnet_b0" model to create a model to take an image of a handwritten English Alphabet as the input and predict the character as the output. 

## Tech Stack
- python (pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, timm)
- image model: efficientnet_b0
- dataset: [English Alphabets by Mohneesh_Sreegirisetty from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohneesh7/english-alphabets)
